# Welcome!  New here?

We require that everyone doing PL development at Berkeley (and if you can see this, that's you) include their
**real name and a reasonable photo** in both their GitHub profile and the Slack channel to which you should have received an email invite.  
Some of the repos you'll have access to
contain sensitive stuff, e.g. exam questions, so we need to know who you are, especially if your real identity
is not obvious from your GitHub username.  **Please take a moment now to add your real name and photo to your GitHub and Slack profiles.**

Use this repo's [wiki](https://github.com/ace-lab/pl-ucb-csxxx/wiki)
to contribute knowledge.  If you're new to the project, [start there](https://github.com/ace-lab/pl-ucb-csxxx/wiki)
for instructions on getting set up.
