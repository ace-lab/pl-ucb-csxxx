# Faded Parsons example

The `serverFilesQuestion/compute_poly.yaml` file is the original representation used by the
standalone FPP tool...in a normal FPP question (once this element is
implemented), this file should never be needed.

The problem prompt (`problem_description` key in the file) just goes
into a `pl-question-panel` element in `question.html`.

See the element directory's `pl-faded-parsons.md` for documentation on
what other files are needed.
