  Make a function <code>square_color</code> that tells if a chess 
square is black based off of its position (see the labeled board below).

<h3> Background </h3>

In this activity we will be using modulo (%)! It is often spoken about as
the remainder, the complement to integer division. We often use it to find if something 
is even or odd, by inspecting if <code>x % 2 == 0</code> for even and 
<code>x % 2 == 1</code> for odd.

Another way to think of it is to convert <i>linear</i> change into 
<i>cyclic</i> change. Consider how it acts on this linearly increasing list:

<pl-code language="python">
nums = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
print([x % 3 for x in nums])
>> [0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2]</pl-code>

It turns 0..8 into (0, 1 , 2) repeating!

### Provided
 - `to_coordinates: python fn(str) -> tuple[int, int]`, turns a file-and-rank string and turns it into an (int, int),<br>eg 'a1' -> (0, 0), 'd6' -> (3, 5)
</markdown>

  def square_color(pos): #0given
  file, rank = to_coordinates(pos)
  black_first_square = file % !BLANK == 0
  same_as_first = rank % !BLANK == 0
  return black_first_square == same_as_first
